Other info about building the Typhon IDEs (32 and 64) from CodeTyphon app:

Observed requirements for building the IDEs: about 6.5GB of RAM is required to build the "Big" IDEs (a 64-bit computer is needed for both).
If the "Big" IDEs can't be directly built (may finish with errors), please start with the "Small" ones.
Because of this high amount of required RAM, in the latest versions, the 32-bit IDE comes preconfigured not to install various packages.
